# RESSBIO: REmote Sensing Spectroscopy for wetlands BIOdiversity

![Albufera_CHL_map](https://github.com/Grcf2585/RESSBIO/assets/92304222/3a65f864-e0dc-4327-8201-d2a18a9c4b88)

The water ecological parameters jupyter notebook is an open-source code developed in Python that runs on Google Colab to interpret and compare chlorophyll, phycocyanin, and Secchi disk depth time series data obtained from retrieval models based on S2 multispectral data. The models have been trained with in-situ data collected from several water reservoirs in Spain. The main authors are Gabriel Caballero, and Javier Soria-Perpina as part of the Image Processing Laboratory at the University of Valencia.

For a comprehensive overview of field campaigns and on-site data acquisition, see the [ESAQS](https://leoipl.uv.es/esaqs/) project webpage.

## Description
This repository contains the source codes for inland water ecological parameters retrieval through GEE using Python.
